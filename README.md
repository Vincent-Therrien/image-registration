# Challenge 2: Image Registration

This project has been created as part of an internship application process at
GHGSat. It comprises an image registration program, a test suite, a build
compiled for the ARM platform, and a Docker container. More precisely, the
repository is organized in the following subdirectories:
- **docs** contains the source files for building the documentation using
  Sphinx and a build of the documentation. To read the documentation, open
  the file docs/build/index.html.
- **image-registration** contains the source files for the application and
  a version compiled for the ARM platform.
- **tests** contains the test suite.

The procedure to build, use, and test the application is described in the
[user guide](#user-guide) below. Possible [improvements](#improvements) are
listed at the end of the file.
