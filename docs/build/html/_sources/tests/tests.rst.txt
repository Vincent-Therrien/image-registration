Test Suite
==========

The testing procedure is made with Pytest and is separated in two main
components: command line interface tests and image registration tests.

For information on how to run tests, refer to the user guide.

Command Line Interface Tests
----------------------------

These tests check if the program reacts appropriately to command line
arguments. It checks version display, help message display, and if invalid
inputs make the program fail as expected.

Image Registration Tests
------------------------

The package "imagehash", available through pip, is used to compare how similar
aligned images are to expected results. Two tests are performed:

First, an image rotated by 45 degrees counter clock wise is aligned. It is
expected to yield a non-rotated image.

Second, the rotated image is cropped so that only its left half is aligned.
Since it is rotated, this area corresponds to the top left half of the original
image. The test thus compares the result to the image
"test_image_gray_half.png".
