The image-registration program uses the ORB algorithm to align images.
Images can be selected in two ways:

- Full images can be selected automatically by providing no key word argument
  next to the image file path.
- The "-c" argument enables selection of a rectangle from the command line.
- The "-g" argument opens a graphical interface to select the region of
  interest manually.

Instructions on how to build the executable file and run the tests are given
in the user guide.
